    "# Text Adventure!\n",
    "## Overview:\n",
    "* A text-based game adventure, you 'traverse' through randomly generated maps with monsters or shops.\n",
    "* In each map with monsters, you can either fight or use an item or run away.\n",
    "* When monsters are killed, you get experience and item drops. The base chance of an item dropping is set to 1 (100%) right now. Because items are stored in a player's backpack (dictionary structure), they would overwrite same-named items. So instead, the values are added together and 'stacked' such that if you had a potion that healed for 5 and got another potion that healed for 5, you would just have one potion that healed for 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "* Object inheritance among the items, the 'actors' (player and monsters), and the locations allows for organization and general function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Known Issues:\n",
    "* For some reason, sometimes input() does not call and no box is displayed for the user to write something. Hasn't happened in a while but just letting you know.\n",
    "* Game design - balancing needs to be done...\n"
